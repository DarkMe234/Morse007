# Morse007

*Morse 007* is a James Bond-themed soccer game explicitly designed to help a client with limited accessibility to learn Morse code, using Google's Gboard. As a part of the Game Jam hosted by [Adaptive Design](http://www.adaptivedesign.org/) in partnership with [Google Creative Lab](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/morse), we built *Morse 007* working closely with our client from the very beginning to meet the specific needs and interests of the client.

Teamwork with [Jungsoo Park](https://uxjungsoopark.com/), Taeyeon Kim, and [Emily Saltz](https://saltzshaker.github.io/)
